# Process-Mining-
This is a Process Mining repository I developed during my Master in Business Analytics. It contains pm4py notebooks for exploring a traffic-fines event log, DFG, variants, and Alpha Miner; some notebooks are tutorial material provided by teaching staff, and others are evaluation exercises authored by me.
