# Process-Mining-
This is a Process Mining repository I developed during my Master in Business Analytics. The notebooks use pm4py to explore a simulated traffic fines management event log: case/event exploration, variant analysis, Directly-Follows Graph, footprint relations (parallelism), and Alpha Miner Petri-net discovery on filtered subsets. Several notebooks were provided by teaching staff as tutorials, while others are evaluation exercises I authored.
